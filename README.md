This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 14.1.1.

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build & Deploy

Run `npm run build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

### Local

Run `npm run start` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The application will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

### Android

Run `ng build-android`, which will build the angular app, setup the Android app in `Android/`, generate the apk and copy it into `releases/apk`. You can then copy it and install it on your Android device.

### Chrome extension

    "build-ghpages": "ng build --base-href \"https://AurecchiaP.github.io/\"",

Run `npm run build` to build the project. Add `dist/card-learner` as an unpacked extension to chrome.

### Github pages

Run `npm run build-ghpages`, which is a normal build with the href pointing to your GitHub Pages path (you may have to update this command with your GitHub username).
Run `npm run deploy-ghpages` to commit `dist/card-learner` to branch `gh-pages`, then go to your repository on github, settings, pages, and choose this branch as the page config.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
